You can export your prompt to an image which you can share online. You have the ability to align it correctly and add your name for credits too.

:::warning
Some glyphs aren't rendered correctly, that's not you but the limitations of the renderer. Depending on your config, you might have to tweak
the output a little bit.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="powershell"
  values={[
    { label: 'powershell', value: 'powershell', },
    { label: 'others', value: 'others', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="powershell">

You can make use of the `Export-PoshImage` function to export your current theme configuration.

```powershell
Export-PoshImage -CursorPadding 50
```

There are a couple of parameters you can use to tweak the image rendering:

- `CursorPadding`: spaces to add after the cursor indication (`_`)
- `RPromptOffset`: spaces to add **before** a block that's right aligned
- `Author`: the name of the creator, added after `https://ohmyposh.dev`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="others">

The oh-my-posh executable has the `--export-png` switch to export your current theme configuration.

```powershell
oh-my-posh --config ~/.mytheme.omp.json --export-png --cursor-padding 50
```

There are a couple of additional switches you can use to tweak the image rendering:

- `--cursor-padding`: spaces to add after the cursor indication (`_`)
- `--rprompt-offset`: spaces to add **before** a block that's right aligned
- `--author`: the name of the creator, added after `https://ohmyposh.dev`
