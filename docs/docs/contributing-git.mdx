While we're mostly used to working with source control, working with a fork and making sure
we can merge swiftly brings some additional challenges. This page aims to help you out with the things you might
get asked to do, but may be outside of your comfort zone.

Sit back, relax and bring your towel.

## I didn't stick to the conventional commit guidelines

### I only have 1 commit

To reword the last commit, we can make use of git's `--amend` switch to add something to our latest commit (code, changes, rewording).
Use the following comands to rephrase the last commit and get that change merged!

```bash
git commit --amend -m "feat: better worded feature"`
git push --force
```

### I added more than commit

If all of your commits need to go to main because it makes sense to treat these as atomic units, you can use git's interactive rebase
functionality to reword any commit between `main` and your `HEAD`. To start an interactive rebase, type `git rebase -i main`.

This will open your `$EDITOR` and you can mark the commits you want to reword with `reword` (or `r`) rather than `pick`.
Exiting that file will start the rebase and spwan your `$EDITOR` to alter the commit message for each commit you marked as `reword`.

Once done, use `git push --force` to bring the changes to the pull request.

:::info vscode
The latest version of vscode has a built-in gui to help you select `reword` or any other action on a commit. Select the right ones and press
Start Rebase to continue.
